                One of Seven Wonders of the World, White Marble Mughal Architecture, the Taj Mahal was built by emperor
                Shah Jahan in the memory of his wife, Mumtaj Mahal. It is located at the bank of river Yamuna in Agra.
                It was completed in 1653 with the estimated cost of 32 million Indian rupees which would today stand up
                to 58 billion Indian rupees. It is considered as the best example of Mughal architecture worldwide and
                is called the “Jewel of Muslim Art in India”. This is probably the monument that is most recognised the
                world over for its association with the Indian heritage sites.
